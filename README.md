# Warmer Walker
### Walk around your neighbourhood playing warmer / colder

This is a mobile app built with [React Native]. So far, you have to install it from source to try it out. Follow the instructions to set up a React Native [development environment], and then launch the Metro bundler:

    npx react-native start

In another terminal, launch the app:

    npx react-native run-android

It's built around the Google [Streetview API].
